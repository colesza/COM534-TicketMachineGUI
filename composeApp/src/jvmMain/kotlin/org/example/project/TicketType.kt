// enum classes allow us to define a series of constants which we can use in place of integers
// to represent one of a range of values.
// Here we are defining an enum class "TicketType" which can have the possible values
// SINGLE or RETURN.
// See the documentation: https://kotlinlang.org/docs/enum-classes.html
enum class TicketType {
    SINGLE, RETURN
}
